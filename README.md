# Reinforcement-Learning
 Trained an AI-based explorer to play a game by reinforcement learing. As demonstrated below, in this game, the treasure (denoted by T) is on the right-most and the explorer (denoted by o) will learn to get the treasure by moving left and right. The explorer will be rewarded when it gets the treasure. After serveral epoches, the explorer will learn how to get the treasure faster and finally it will go to the treasure by moving to right directly. \
